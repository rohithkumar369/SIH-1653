## Problem Title
 Tackling Food Waste and Hunger
## Problem Description
Background:India faces a dual challenge: excessive food wastage and widespread hunger. According to studies, over 67 million tonnes of food are wasted annuallyâ€”enough to feed millions. Simultaneously, a significant portion of the population remains undernourished, with limited access to sufficient and nutritious food.
One of the main reasons for this paradox is the lack of a structured system that can facilitate the redistribution of surplus food from sources like restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, events, and households to those in need. Many NGOs and charitable organizations are working to bridge this gap, but they lack a technological platform that can connect, coordinate, and optimize food recovery and delivery.


## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution (MoCAF&PD)

## Idea
1.Real-time Platform: Connects food donors (restaurants, households, events) with nearby NGOs and volunteers.

2.Smart Logistics: Uses location tracking and optimized routes for quick food pickup and delivery.

3.Food Safety: Tracks preparation time and expiry to ensure hygienic food distribution.

4.Volunteer Coordination: Notifies available volunteers for pickup and delivery tasks.

5.Impact Tracking: Dashboard shows meals served, food saved, and carbon footprint reduced.

6.Transparency & Feedback: Ratings and logs help maintain quality and trust across all users.
